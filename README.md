This repo is about LangChain Agents on creating a chatbot to interact with CSV files using OpenAI's LLMs. 

Would you like to integrate ChatGPT into your CSV? With LangChain's framework, we can develop language model-powered applications that are aware of data and can interact with their environment.

Here i am building a chatbot agent that uses ChatGPT's LLM to answer questions about a CSV file.
